A popular sweet-tasting root vegetable, carrots are narrow and cone shaped. They have thick, fleshy, deeply colored root, which grows underground, and feathery green leaves that emerge above the ground. While these greens are fresh tasting and slightly bitter, the carrot roots are crunchy textured with a sweet and minty aromatic taste. Benefits Carrots provide the highest content of vitamin A of all the vegetables. Brightly orange colored carrots have pigments like carotenoids and flavonoids, that provide several antioxidants and act as a defense against cancer. They aid in maintaining oral health and also decrease the risk of stroke and other heart diseases.'",

  "description": "Raw mangoes, picked when just mature, are also known as “Green mangoes.” Mangoes grow at the ends of long stems on evergreen trees in sub-tropical and tropical regions around the globe. Raw mangoes are firm and can be oval or slightly kidney bean-ed, depending on the variety. The mangoes aren’t fully developed, so the seed is small and thin and the firm flesh is crisp. The flavor is sharply sour and can be slightly bitter due to concentrations of oxalic, citric and other types of acids which aren’t present in a ripe mango. The skin of some varieties of raw mango contain oils that can be irritating to those who have a sensitivity to poison ivy or oak, which is a distant relative of the mango. However, those with sensitivities to the skin genelly don’t experience any irritation from the flesh.\r\n\r\nGreen mango can be sour or nutty and sweet depending on the variety. The sour ones are used in the place of lime or in combination with lime in Thai dishes. An unripe mango is very hard when you touch it and does not give in like a ripe fruit.\r\n",

The inner flesh of the mature seed, as well as the coconut milk extracted from it, form a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid, called coconut water or coconut juice. Mature, ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds, or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh, charcoal from the hard shell, and coir from the fibrous husk. Dried coconut flesh is called copra, and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking – frying in particular – as well as in soaps and cosmetics. Sweet coconut sap can be made into drinks or fermented into palm wine or coconut vinegar. The hard shells, fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decoration.",

It is believed to have originated in the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. A ripe fresh mango can be described as tasting sweet, citrus, and almost melon flavor all in one. I think of them as a combination of peach, orange, and cantaloupe. Because of the way mango smells, I also find them to also have a floral and tropical, like papaya and pineapple taste to them as well.\r\n\r\n",
